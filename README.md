# FBXEssentials
A work in progress xD

3ds Max is great, but can't export with multiple animation stacks >_<

So could only have them all put together in one take using motion mixer and try to play them at separate timelines :S

Project so far can read .fbx file and get frame count

My models biceps are distorted haha will try fix later

Cluster is another name for bone I think lol

Requires Fbx SDK
